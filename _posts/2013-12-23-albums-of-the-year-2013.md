After much deliberation and thought, here's my top 50 albums of the year. A few narrowly missed out and I would have liked to have listened to a few more which would have surely charted fairly highly, namely Protest the Hero, Toy, Soulfly, Motorhead and maybe a few others. Mixed genres so hard to judge whats better than what in a lot of cases so I've done it based on how much i enjoyed each album.
