Here's my top 20 albums of the year spanning all genres. Its obviously hard to compare them so I've gone with the ones I've enjoyed the most! I've tried to sum them up in one sentence that attempts to make me look clever. Enjoy!


1. Sylosis - Edge Of The Earth

Blackened Thrash Metal
A furiously technical thrash-fest with black overtones that includes guitar riffs that have to be seen live to be believed.


2. Mastodon - The Hunter

Progressive/Sludge Metal
A much more immediate album than Crack The Skye that still offers loads of depth and crushing heaviness. 


3. Megadeth - Th1rt3en

Thrash Metal
Each member of Megadeth is on superb form here, Mustaines song-writing is back to its thrashing hooky best.


4. Evile - Five Serpents Teeth

Thrash Metal
A fantastically technical new thrash album that nods to the past but is totally modern and stands up in its own right.


5. Yuck - Yuck

Indie Rock
Blends Indie, Shoegaze & Slacker Rock in a pleasing Dinosaur Jr. meets Teenage Fanclub Haze.



6. The Black Dahlia Murder - Ritual


Melodic Death/Thrash Metal
Mind meltingly heavy and ridiculously fast, the vocals sound like a banshee burning in the fires of hell.


7. Mazes - A Thousand Heys


Slacker Indie Rock
Ridiculously catchy indie pop, perfect for lazy summer afternoons.


8. Trivium - In Waves


Thrash Metal / Metalcore
A return to form, blending the melodic metalcore elements with some brutal riffage - the formula that made them popular in the first place.


9. Machine Head - Unto The Locust


Heavy Metal
An album that didn't quite live up to it's billing for me, not as immediate as some of the others but gets better with repeat plays.


10. Frank Turner - England Keep My Bones


Folk/Punk Rock
A Billy Bragg meets Levellers Indie Folk effort that includes some truly beautiful tunes and annoyingly catchy melodies.


11. Foo Fighters – Wasting Light


Hard Rock
Probably their best since the 'Color and the shape', some hard rocking fare without straying too far into metal territory. 


12. Skeletonwitch - Forever Abomination


Blackened Thrash/Death Metal
Furious technical death metal, not for the feint of heart.


13. Anthrax - Worship Music


Thrash/Groove Metal
One of their best ever, the trademark groove and party vibe is enhanced by the excellently constructed songs and guitar riffs.


14. Joe Bonamassa - Dust Bowl


Modern Blues
Atmospheric, soulful and bombastic guitar widdling from the master of modern blues.


15. Radiohead - King Of Limbs


Electronic/Experimental
Haunting and beautiful tunes with a lot of depth and interesting electronic sounds.


16. Limp Bizkit – Gold Cobra


Nu Metal
Big, Stupid songs designed for fun and not to be taken seriously; their only album worth listening to since significant other.


17. Edward Sharpe and The Magnetic Zeros - Up From Below


Indie Folk
An uplifting indie record made by a travelling cult of hippies, 'Home' being one of my favourite tracks of the year.


18. The War On Drugs - Slave Ambient


Bossgaze?!
Think Arcade Fire ambience, Bruce Springsteens driving Guitar and Bob Dylans vocals with a shoegazey twist, excellent modern rock.


19. Dawes - Nothing Is Wrong


Indie Rock
Relaxed touchy-feely indie with a great atmosphere and memorable lyrics.


20. Mariachi El Bronx - Mariachi El Bronx II


Mexican Mariachi
Evoking images of a windswept Mexican dust-bowl, this album is great fun and includes superb song-writing and musicianship.
